# üö¶ Trail Network - A project with threads, mutex and semaphores
This project is about a construction of the logic of a trail network, with the intention of having 5 trains using its trails without colliding with eachother or causing deadlocks. Using threads, mutex and semaphores, I made an implementation that can be the solution for the challenge. 
- Buit with QtCreator.

> This project is related to my grad. It is for a subject called "Operational Systems", a class given at IMD/UFRN, Natal, RN, Brazil.
